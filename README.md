Hi!<br>
If you're reading this, that means you downloaded my game or youre reading from github which in that case download the game plz<br>
I just want to let you know that this game is 100% python if you didnt already look on github and uhh its very unpolished, broken and its a dead project anyways<br>
The current Linux version has an issue (shocker) with the color command. It's not game breaking but it's annoying and idk how to fix it cuz im stupid<br>
(also yes all the commits are just for the README im too lazy to update the project<br>
Before playing, you NEED to make sure to follow this quick setup guide:<br><br>

If you don't know how to open a command shell on your device, do this on your according device:<br><br>

Linux:<br>
    1. CTRL + ALT + F2 (idk if this actually works on all major distros)<br>
Windows:<br>
    1. WINDOWS + R<br>
    2. Type in 'cmd'<br>
    3. Press enter (dont click the run button you psychopath/grandma you have a keyboard for a reason)<br><br>

1. If you are unsure if you have python3 installed or know that you don't have it installed, please run these commands:<br><br>

Linux:<br>
    platform specific look it up yourself
Windows:<br>
    1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/<br>
    2. Select the latest python3 version<br>
    3. Scroll to the bottom and click on the recommended Windows installer<br>
    4. Execute the downloaded file and follow the setup<br><br>

2. Download all the packages:<br><br>

Linux & Windows:<br>
    1. Run the following command in a cmd prompt/console: pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br><br>

3. Now that you are all ready to go, you can run the Start file in a cmd prompt/console (Start.bat for Windows and Start.sh for Linux) to play my simple game.<br><br>

Have fun!<br><br><br>

Very much inspired by: Hacknet (Please buy the game if you can, it's incredible)<br><br>


By the way you can very much run the python code on its own but I just like the style of it being run in command prompt and the terminal coloring would probably bug out so I don't recommend doing that.<br>
Irdc <i>what</i> you do with this game so go ahead and fix bugs or add some more :3<br>
As long as you don't sell a 1/1 copy of my game I'm ok with pretty much anything you do with it but before doing anything you should probably read through the whole LICENSE.txt.<br>
I won't be that annoying to anyone with any legal stuff but I also dont want someone to profit off of MY buggy mess of a game and you don't want to get into legal trouble for doing anything I'm fully not OK with, right?<br>

BOOOO QUIT YAPPING YOU <b>SCALLYWAG</b> OFF THE PLANK YOU GO
