Hi!<br>
If you're reading this, that means you downloaded my game!<br>
I just want to let you know that this game runs fully with python.<br>
The current Linux version has an issue with the color command. It's not game breaking but it's annoying<br>
Before playing, you NEED to make sure to follow this quick setup guide:<br><br>

Extra - If you don't know how to open a command shell on your device, do this on your according device:<br><br>

Linux:<br>
    1. CTRL + ALT + F2<br>
Windows:<br>
    1. WINDOWS + R<br>
    2. Type in 'cmd'<br>
    3. Run it<br><br>

1. If you are unsure if you have python3 installed or know that you don't have it installed, please run these commands:<br><br>

Linux:<br>
    1. Update your APT package list by entering following command in a command shell: sudo apt-get update<br>
    2. Install python 3 with the following command: sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip<br>
Windows:<br>
    1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/<br>
    2. Select the latest python3 version<br>
    3. Scroll to the bottom and click on the recommended Windows installer<br>
    4. Execute the downloaded file and follow the setup<br><br>

2. Download all the packages:<br><br>

Linux & Windows:<br>
    1. Run the following command in a shell: pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br><br>

3. Now that you are all ready to go, you can run the Start file (Start.bat for Windows and Start.sh for Linux) to play my simple game.<br><br>

Have fun!<br><br><br>

Very much inspired by: Hacknet (Please buy the game if you can, it's incredible)<br><br>


By the way you can very much run the python code on its own but I just like the style of it being run in command prompt and the terminal coloring would probably bug out so I don't recommend doing that.<br>
But whatever! Do what you want! Go wild! It's your choice.<br>
As long as you don't sell a 1/1 copy of my game I'm ok with pretty much anything you do with it!<br>
But before doing anything I recommended you read through the whole LICENSE.txt.<br>
I won't be that harsh with any legal stuff but just to be sure. You don't want to get into legal trouble for doing anything I'm fully not OK with, do you?<br>
