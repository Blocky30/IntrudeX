I just want to let you know that this game runs fully with python.
Before playing, you NEED to make sure to follow this quick setup guide:

Linux: (Linux is not fully supported right now)
    1. CTRL + ALT + F2
Windows:
    1. WINDOWS + R
    2. Type in 'cmd'
    3. Run it

1. If you are unsure if you have python3 installed or know that you don't have it installed, please run these commands:

Linux:
    1. Update your APT package list by entering following command in a command shell: sudo apt-get update
    2. Install python 3 with the following command: sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
Windows:

Very much inspired by: Hacknet (Please buy the game if you can, it's incredible and in my opinion way better than mine)


By the way you can very much run the python code on its own but I just like the style of it being run in command prompt and the terminal coloring would probably bug out so I don't recommend doing that.
But whatever! Do what you want! Go wild! It's your choice.
As long as you don't sell a 1/1 copy of my game I'm ok with pretty much anything you do with it!
But before doing anything I recommended you read through the whole LICENSE.txt.
I won't be that harsh with any legal stuff but just to be sure. You don't want to get into legal trouble for doing anything I'm fully not OK with, do you?
